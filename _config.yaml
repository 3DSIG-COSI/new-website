title: 3DSIG-COSI
subtitle: Structural Bioinformatics and Computational Biophysics
description: The 3D Special Interest Group (SIG) COSI focuses on all aspects of molecular biology that can be 
              informed by a computational perspective. In broad terms this includes structural bioinformatics 
              approaches dealing with the computational analysis of biological processes at the molecular level 
              from a structural perspective as well as the simulation of biological processes from a molecular 
              biophysicsâ€™ perspective.
